                <span class="underbar"></span><br>
                <p style="line-height: 28px;">
                    Yasham came in to existence when three friends Sunita Mandelia, Smita Kaushal and Shilpa Bhagat joined hands to educate the children at NSS school in Mumbai, India.
                    <br><br>
                    Sunita always believed in power of education. She was tutoring her maid's son and became distraught with the fact that he was in grade five of a semi English school and did not know a word of English. She decided to extend teaching support to the entire school to bridge this learning gap.
                    <br><br>
                    Smita was inspired by her son Dhruv Kaushal to start educating underprivileged children. Dhruv was deeply moved by the widespread prevalence of children excluded from the formal education system in India. Smita and Dhruv put their prior experience in children's education charities together to set up the foundation.
                    <br><br>
                    Shilpa was cofounder of Cuddles Foundation that was involved in cancer relief for underprivileged children. She was distressed by their lack of access to education. She gladly reached out to promote the education initiative. She has been actively involved in launching several initiatives for the foundation.
